				Hey There! I'm Samprad (or Sam if we're already pals) I am an 18 year old from India with an
				insatiable curiosity for tech, design and basically anything that makes the digital world
				tick. I started this portfolio in my 2nd semester to document my journey in Front-End
				Development and explore how creativity and code collide. When I'm not breaking my code (and
				occasionally fixing it), I'm probably obsessing over clean UI, smart user experiences, or
				crafting side projects that nobody asked for-but hey, they're cool!
