				Hey There! I'm Samprad (or Sam if we're already pals) I am an 18 year old from India with an
				insatiable curiosity for tech, design and basically anything that makes the digital world
				tick. I started this portfolio in my 2nd semester to document my journey in Web Development
				and explore how creativity and code collide. When I'm not breaking my code (and occasionally
				fixing it), I'm probably dragging myself through college life, or collaborating with
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@acollegekidproductions" class = "link text-[#84dcc6]">ACK</a>, or crafting side projects
				that nobody asked for-but hey, they're cool!
